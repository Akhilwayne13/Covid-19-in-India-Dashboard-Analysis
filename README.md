#Covid-19 in India Dashboard Analysis (Tableau Project)

This project is a comprehensive Tableau dashboard that visualizes the spread, testing, and impact of COVID-19 across India. It includes insights into vaccination, age/gender-wise distribution, statewise comparisons, and lab testing capacities using real or simulated data.
